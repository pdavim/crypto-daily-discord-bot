# Crypto Daily Discord Bot – Comprehensive Task Breakdown

This document enumerates the concrete actions required to implement the features and enhancements outlined in the product briefing. Tasks are grouped by capability so that delivery teams can estimate, sequence, and assign work efficiently.

## 1. Foundations & Infrastructure
- [ ] Review the existing repository structure, configuration defaults, and environment variables to confirm which capabilities are already implemented versus planned.
- [ ] Create or update architecture diagrams covering data pipelines, scheduling, Discord interactions, and external integrations.
- [ ] Establish development and staging Discord servers, Binance testnet accounts, Google Cloud projects, and OpenRouter credentials for safe testing.
- [ ] Define configuration schemas (JSON/YAML) that support feature toggles (e.g., `ENABLE_FORECASTING`, `ENABLE_TRADING`) and map them to runtime loaders.
- [ ] Implement centralized logging and telemetry conventions (e.g., structured JSON logs, Prometheus metrics) to monitor new modules.
- [ ] Document security practices for managing API keys and secrets (rotation procedures, vault integrations, `.env` handling).

## 2. Daily Technical Analysis & Charting Pipeline
### Data Acquisition
- [ ] Integrate Binance REST/WebSocket APIs (and optional alternative exchanges) to fetch historical candles, recent trades, and volume statistics at required intervals.
- [ ] Implement retry logic, rate-limit handling, and caching for fetched market data.
- [ ] Normalize data into a consistent schema (timestamp, open/high/low/close/volume) stored in local cache or database.

### Indicator Computation
- [ ] Select or build indicator utilities for SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, MACD, RSI, and configurable custom metrics.
- [ ] Parameterize indicator periods and calculation windows via configuration per asset/timeframe.
- [ ] Validate indicator outputs with unit tests using known sample datasets.

### Chart Generation & Summaries
- [ ] Choose a charting library (e.g., Chart.js with node-canvas or Plotly) capable of producing PNG outputs headlessly.
- [ ] Implement chart templates displaying candlesticks, overlays (indicators, support/resistance levels), and annotations (trend arrows, emojis).
- [ ] Generate automated textual summaries highlighting trend direction, momentum, key levels, and notable signals.
- [ ] Localize or format summaries for Discord (Markdown, emojis) and optional report exports.

### Scheduling & Delivery
- [ ] Configure a scheduler/cron service to run the analysis pipeline at configurable times per asset group.
- [ ] Implement Discord posting logic (webhook or bot client) targeting specific channels with captions and attachments.
- [ ] Add validation to prevent duplicate postings and to handle missed runs (catch-up mode).
- [ ] Create integration tests or dry-run scripts to verify charts render correctly and align with textual summaries.

## 3. Alert Notifications for Price Events

## 5. Portfolio Growth Simulation
- [ ] Design simulation engine mirroring live strategy logic (signal ingestion, risk management, execution rules).
- [ ] Load historical price series and configuration for initial capital, target, timeframe, and asset allocation.
- [ ] Implement portfolio accounting (positions, cash, fees, slippage, compounding) and risk events (drawdowns, rebalancing).
- [ ] Generate metrics including final equity, CAGR, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, volatility, and trade statistics.
- [ ] Produce visualizations (equity curve, drawdown chart) and textual reports summarizing assumptions and results.
- [ ] Allow simulations to run asynchronously/background with status tracking and completion notifications to Discord.
- [ ] Validate engine with short historical windows and compare against known benchmarks (buy-and-hold) to ensure realism.

## 6. Discord Commands & Market Reports
- [ ] Implement slash command registration (`/help`, `/chart`, `/analysis`, `/alerts`, `/config`, etc.) with proper permissions and rate limits.
- [ ] Build command handlers that fetch or generate requested data (charts, summaries, alert status) and respond with Discord embeds or files.
