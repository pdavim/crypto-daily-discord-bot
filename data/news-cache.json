Meanwhile, profit-taking metrics indicate the Bitcoin bull cycle may be entering its late phase.\n\n3. **Market Movements**: A $1.25 billion Bitcoin futures flush raised questions about market implications. Despite a broader crypto market drop, Avalanche (AVAX) surged by 10%, bucking the trend.\n\n4. **Industry Updates**: Trump-backed World Liberty Financial plans to launch a debit card, adding to the growing crypto payment solutions.",
